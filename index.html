This phenomenon was first identified in a 1977 study at Villanova University and Temple University. When truth is assessed, people rely on whether the information is in line with their understanding or if it feels familiar. The first condition is logical, as people compare new information with what they already know to be true. Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new, unrepeated statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful. The illusory truth effect has also been linked to hindsight bias, in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth has been received.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"category":"Too Much Information","subcategory":"We notice things already primed in memory or repeated often","name":"Mere-exposure effect","article":"Mere-exposure_effect","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cb\u003emere-exposure effect\u003c/b\u003e is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop liking or disliking for things merely because they are familiar with them.

The impact of context effects is considered to be part of top-down design. The concept is supported by the theoretical approach to perception known as constructive perception. Context effects can impact our daily lives in many ways such as word recognition, learning abilities, memory, and object recognition. It can have an extensive effect on marketing and consumer decisions. For example, research has shown that the comfort level of the floor that shoppers are standing on while reviewing products can affect their assessments of product's quality, leading to higher assessments if the floor is comfortable and lower ratings if it is uncomfortable. Because of effects such as this, context effects are currently studied predominantly in marketing.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"category":"Too Much Information","subcategory":"We notice things already primed in memory or repeated often","name":"Cue-dependent forgetting","article":"Cue-dependent_forgetting","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCue-dependent forgetting\u003c/b\u003e, or \u003cb\u003eretrieval failure\u003c/b\u003e, is the failure to recall information without memory \u003ci\u003ecues\u003c/i\u003e.

In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative.

Both numeric and non-numeric anchoring have been reported in research. In numeric anchoring, once the value of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates, etc. made by an individual may change from what they would have otherwise been without the anchor. For example, an individual may be more likely to purchase a car if it is placed alongside a more expensive model. Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market value of the car.
